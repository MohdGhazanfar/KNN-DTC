# KNN-DTC
Title: K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree Classifiers

Description:
This repository contains Python code for implementing the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm and decision tree classifiers with entropy and gini criterion for supervised learning. The KNN implementation includes the option to **build the algorithm from scratch** or use the scikit-learn library's built-in functions. The iris dataset is used to train and test the classifiers, and their accuracy is evaluated on the testing set. The repository also includes code to **compare the performance of the decision tree classifiers** and visualize their decision tree structure and feature importance.

With this code, you can learn and experiment with KNN and decision tree classifiers for supervised learning tasks. You can also modify and improve the code to fit your specific use case.
